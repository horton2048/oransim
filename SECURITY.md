## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, open a private security advisory at
<https://github.com/horton2048/augur/security/advisories/new> with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact (availability / confidentiality / integrity)
- Your suggested fix if you have one

You will receive an acknowledgment within 3 business days. We aim to issue a patch or mitigation within 30 days for critical findings, 90 days otherwise.

We follow responsible disclosure: please allow us to ship a fix before publishing details. Contributors who report valid vulnerabilities will be credited in our `SECURITY-HALL-OF-FAME.md` (opt-in).

## Scope

In-scope:
- The `oransim` Python package and bundled scripts
- Official Docker images (when available)

Out-of-scope:
