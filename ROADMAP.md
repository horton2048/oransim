# Augur Roadmap

> **Updated:** 2026-04-19 · **Current version:** 0.2.0-alpha
>
> This roadmap is aspirational. Item inclusion does not guarantee delivery; priorities shift with user feedback, research breakthroughs, and commercial signal. Give a 👍 reaction on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/horton2048/augur/issues) to help us prioritize.

Augur's roadmap is organized across three horizons and eight themes. Each horizon is cumulative — v1.0 ships everything from v0.2 and v0.5 plus new items.

- **v0.2 · Near** — 6~12 weeks (target Q3 2026)
- **v0.5 · Mid** — 3~6 months (target Q4 2026 – Q1 2027)
- **v1.0+ · Far** — 2027 and beyond (vision / conference-grade research)

Themes:
1. 🧠 **Models & Algorithms**
2. 🌐 **Platforms**
3. 🔌 **LLM Providers**
4. 📊 **Data & Benchmarks**
5. 🏗️ **Infrastructure**
6. 📦 **SDK & Integrations**
7. 🌱 **Ecosystem**
8. 📄 **Research & Publications**

## v0.2 · Near (Q3 2026)

### 🧠 Models & Algorithms
- Canonical schema v1.1 with richer field coverage (creative metadata, audience micro-segments, time-of-day priors)
- World model retains LightGBM quantile (P35/P50/P65) as the baseline
- Incremental PCA retraining pipeline with documented procedure
- Hill saturation + frequency-fatigue curves formalized as public API
- ✅ **Learned amortized abduction** (shipped post-0.2) — pure-numpy MLP `q(U | O)` in `oransim.causal.abduction`; `counterfactual._amortized_abduct(mode="learned")` uses it. sbi-based NPE normalizing-flow remains Enterprise-only.
- ⏸ **CT / NH pretrained weights deferred** — the current synthetic corpus is fully inside the LightGBM + ParametricHawkes baselines' hypothesis class, so training the research-grade models would produce factual R² at-or-below baselines. Weight release re-tied to the OrancBench v0.5 causal-native task suite (see v0.5 Data & Benchmarks).

### 🌐 Platforms
- ✅ TikTok adapter MVP (shipped — `backend/oransim/platforms/tiktok/`, wired via `POST /api/adapters/tiktok/simulate_impression`)
- ✅ **TikTok agent-level simulation** (shipped post-0.2) — `TikTokWorldModel` + `TikTokRecSysRLSimulator` + `TikTokPRS` stub; `TikTokAdapter.simulate_impression_agents` / `.simulate_fyp_rl`
- ✅ Douyin adapter MVP (shipped — `backend/oransim/platforms/douyin/`, same adapter surface)
- ✅ Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts adapter MVP (shipped — 4 short-video adapters total)
- XHS adapter docs hardened (`docs/en/platforms/xhs.md`)

### 🔌 LLM Providers
- OpenAI-compatible client hardening (model fallback chain, retry with jitter)
- `.env.example` with all supported providers configured

### 📊 Data & Benchmarks
- OrancBench v0.1 — 50 synthetic scenarios with auto-scored outputs
- Model card v1.0 for shipped pkl
- Data card v1.0 for synthetic dataset

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- Docker Compose one-shot launch
- MkDocs site deployed to GitHub Pages (`/docs/en/` + `/docs/zh/`)
- CI green: ruff + black + pytest with coverage gate

### 📦 SDK & Integrations
- Python SDK stub (`pip install oransim-sdk`) with basic CLI

### 🌱 Ecosystem
- Discord server launch
- Weekly "Office Hours" livestream (first 8 weeks)
- Project blog / changelog
- Hacker News / Product Hunt announcement

### 📄 Research & Publications
- Blog post: *Causal Data Augmentation for Sparse Marketing Prediction*
- Technical note: *Hill Saturation + Frequency Fatigue — Why Linear Budget Scaling Is Wrong*

## v0.5 · Mid (Q4 2026 – Q1 2027)

### 🧠 Models & Algorithms
- ✅ ~~Neural Hawkes Process~~ — **shipped in v0.1.0-alpha** as `CausalNeuralHawkesProcess` (Zuo ICML'20 + Geng NeurIPS'22 counterfactual TPP). Pretrained weights arrive with OrancBench v0.5.
- ✅ ~~Transformer World Model~~ — **shipped in v0.1.0-alpha** as `CausalTransformerWorldModel` (CaT + CausalDAG-Transformer + TARNet/Dragonnet + BCAUSS + CInA). Pretrained weights arrive with OrancBench v0.5.
- 🎯 **Pretrained-weight release** — trained checkpoints for both primary models on the 100k synthetic corpus, published at https://github.com/horton2048/augur/releases
- 🎯 **Cross-platform transfer learning** — pretrain world model on XHS data, fine-tune on TikTok with few-shot adapter layer; quantify transfer gain
- 🎯 **Multi-modal embedders** — v0.2 ships stub classes (`ImageEmbedderStub` / `VideoEmbedderStub` / `AudioEmbedderStub` in `runtime/embedding_bus.py`) that raise `NotImplementedError` pointing here. v0.5 lands real backends:
  - **Image**: CLIP (OpenAI) / Qwen-VL (Alibaba) / SigLIP (Google) / ImageBind (Meta)
  - **Video**: I-JEPA v2 (Meta) / TimeSformer / VideoMAE v2, or Qwen-VL video mode — typical choice is image backbone + temporal pooling for short-form video (TikTok / Reels / Shorts 15-60s)
  - **Audio**: Whisper-v3 encoder (OpenAI, speech-heavy) / CLAP (music, ambient) / AudioMAE — primary use case is BGM-mood recognition for short-video creatives
  - Drop-in via the existing `Embedder` ABC — no downstream changes in agent / world_model / causal layers (UEB registry is already modality-generic)
- **Vision-Language Model (VLM) creative understanding** — use the embedders above + existing Causal Transformer world model to score creatives end-to-end (image → embedding → predicted KPI uplift); compare against text-only baseline
- **RLHF for soul agents** — fine-tune the LLM persona layer using real marketer thumbs-up/down feedback

### 🌐 Platforms
- Instagram adapter MVP (Reels + Feed)
- YouTube Shorts adapter MVP
- Twitter / X adapter stub → MVP (tweets + replies + retweets)
- WeChat 视频号 adapter stub
- Twitch adapter stub

### 🔌 LLM Providers
- ✅ **Multi-LLM-format adapters landed in v0.2** — native `Anthropic /v1/messages`, Google `generateContent`, Qwen DashScope `/generation` shipped alongside the existing OpenAI-compat client. Route via `LLM_PROVIDER={openai|anthropic|gemini|qwen}`. See `backend/oransim/agents/llm_providers/`.
- 🎯 **Still on the list for v0.5**:
  - AWS Bedrock Converse (SigV4 via `boto3`)
  - Azure OpenAI (`/openai/deployments/{name}/chat/completions`)
  - xAI Grok (currently usable via OpenAI-compat path)
  - DeepSeek native (currently usable via OpenAI-compat path)
  - Native streaming for Anthropic / Gemini / Qwen (only OpenAI-compat streams today)

### 📊 Data & Benchmarks
- 🎯 **OrancBench v0.5** — **causal-native redesign** (not just scaling up scenarios). Three new task families that factual-R² baselines fundamentally cannot win:
  1. **Confounded treatment task** — generator introduces `budget ↔ kol_tier` correlation (higher budgets deliberately assigned to higher-tier KOLs). Metric: counterfactual MAE under `do(budget=X, kol_tier=nano)`. LightGBM learns the spurious correlation; CausalTransformer's HSIC + per-arm head estimates the actual CATE.
  2. **CATE heterogeneity task** — per-arm treatment effect varies with covariates (high-engagement KOLs are budget-insensitive; low-engagement are very sensitive). Metric: per-segment CATE R². LightGBM computes factual means — noisy when differenced; CT's per-arm head models it directly.
  3. **Temporal intervention task** — `do(mute_at_min=day_3)` rollouts where boosting stops mid-campaign. Metric: per-day forecast MAE. ParametricHawkes uses fixed exponential kernels — poor on sharp policy changes; CausalNeuralHawkes's attention-over-history adapts.
- **Pretrained weights ship here**, tied to demonstrating ≥2× improvement on at least two of the three causal tasks vs baselines. No weights released before this milestone is met.
- Public leaderboard (hosted alongside the repo)
- Synthetic generator v2 — comparative study of Copula vs GMM vs VAE
- Evaluation protocol spec (`docs/en/benchmarks/protocol.md`)

## Explicitly Out of Scope

To keep the project focused, these are **not** on the roadmap (may change with community demand):

- Generic recommendation systems (beyond marketing-adjacent use cases)
- Consumer-facing social media analytics dashboards (we're an infrastructure/framework, not an end-user BI tool)
- Real-time bidding (RTB) SSP/DSP — adjacent market, different compliance profile
- Generic time-series forecasting (use Prophet / Neural Prophet / GluonTS instead)
